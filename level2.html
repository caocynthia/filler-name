      "social realism": "<div class='word'>social realism</div>Refers to work by writers, painters, filmmakers, printmakers and photographers to draw criticism to the socio-political climate of the time to critique the unequal power dynamics. Lange used her medium as a way to document events such as the Great Depression and the era of Japanese internment.",
      "tone": "<div class='word'>tone</div>Levels of brightness in a photograph, Lange used mostly dark tones, which is referred to as low key. This made the subject matter of the photograph feel more heavy and dramatic.",
      "documentary photography": "<div class='word'>documentary photography</div>Lange is most known as a documentary photographer, a form of photography that is used to chronicle events or environments, both significant and small, relevant to history, often used in reportage.",
      "portraits": "<div class='word'>portraits</div>Portrait photography does not simply mean a photo of a person. Instead, it should say something about the subject (person, animal, object) that you are photographing or the person that you are creating with the camera. Lange is remembered for her intimate portraits of people during tumultuous times, and her ability to evoke emotions through her style.",
      "discretion": "<div class='word'>discretion</div>When the photographer does not want the person photographed to know that there is a photographer present. Her photographs wanted to capture the subject in a moment, and she tries to make herself be as discreet as possible, allowing for stronger, more intimate moments.",
      "Graflex": "<div class='word'>Graflex</div>Lange’s preferred camera, a Graflex single-lens camera. They were heavy and bulky, but they were more accurate in portrait photography. In the right hands, they were also able to produce good quality black and white images.",
      "light": "<div class='word'>light</div>How the light source (either natural or artificial), is positioned in relation to the subject. Lange’s use of light was able to convey certain evocative emotions through her photos.",
      "composition": "<div class='word'>composition</div>How different elements of an image are arranged within the frame. Photographers can control their composition in a variety of ways. Lange would usually take multiple photos at a time, adjusting composition each time. The focus of this photography is the young girl in the center, and Lange’s use of composition really allows the audience to observe that.",
      "depth of field": "<div class='word'>depth of field</div>The difference between the closest and farthest in-focus objects in a photo. A shallow depth of field means that relatively close background objects become blurry, and a deep depth of field means that faraway background objects are still in focus. The students in the background of the photo are still in focus, showing that Lange preferred using deep depth of field in her photos.",
